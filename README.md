# KeyTest
The Key Test is a Windows Terminal application in C# used for testing if keys work, or whatever other reason you need your keys outputted to you. Lots of "commands" to tinker with the app and useful outputs! More updates coming.

The Key Test is only compatible with Windows. It uses C# with the .NET 7.0 framework.

Open "Typing Text.exe" to run the program. The files call it Typing Test as that was the original name.

To understand the outputs shown, you can do the following to get a tutorial:
1. Get into command mode. How to do this is in the welcome message, but it's Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F2.
2. Use the "howRead" command. Remember, commands are case sensitive. You'll get a tutorial on how to understand the outputs that the key test gives.
3. Use the "exitCommand" command to exit command mode, or use the "list" command to see all commands and what they do.

In the future, there will be a way to save configurations done with commands, and more commands.
